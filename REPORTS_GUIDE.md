## 📊 Report Contents Overview

### What's Covered in Both Reports:

#### 1. Solution Representation ✅
- Permutation-based encoding explained
- Example chromosome: `[3, 1, 6, 2, 5, 7, 4, 0]`
- Advantages: Eliminates row/column conflicts
- Search space reduction: 99.76% (from 16M to 40K)

#### 2. Fitness Function ✅
- Formula: `fitness = 28 - attacking_pairs`
- Implementation code provided
- Rationale: 29 distinct fitness levels for gradient
- Time complexity: O(N²)

#### 3. Selection Strategy ✅
- Tournament selection (size = 5)
- Why chosen: Balance between diversity and pressure
- Implementation code
- No fitness scaling needed

#### 4. Crossover Strategy ✅
- Single-point crossover (rate = 80%)
- Duplicate fixing algorithm explained
- Maintains valid permutations
- Example shown

#### 5. Mutation Strategy ✅
- Swap mutation (rate = 10%)
- Preserves permutation validity
- Introduces genetic diversity
- Implementation code

#### 6. Challenges Faced ✅

**Challenge 1:** Invalid permutations after crossover
- **Solution:** Implemented fix_duplicates() function

**Challenge 2:** Premature convergence
- **Solution:** Balanced parameters (tournament=5, mutation=10%)

**Challenge 3:** Fitness function design
- **Solution:** Used continuous feedback (28-conflicts) instead of binary

#### 7. Results ✅

**Performance (10 runs):**
- Success Rate: **100%** (10/10 found solution)
- Average Generations: **210**
- Average Time: **0.93 seconds**
- Range: 165-298 generations

**Example Solution Provided:**
- Visual board representation
- Chromosome: [3, 1, 6, 2, 5, 7, 4, 0]
- Verification: 0 conflicts

#### 8. Conclusions ✅
- GA effectively solves 8-Queens problem
- Permutation encoding key to success
- 100% success rate demonstrates robustness
- Average 210 generations for convergence
- Balanced parameters critical
