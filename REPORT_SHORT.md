# 8-Queens Genetic Algorithm Report

## 1. Solution Representation

I used **permutation encoding** where each chromosome is a list `[0-7]` with index = column and value = row:
```python
chromosome = [3, 1, 6, 2, 5, 7, 4, 0]  # Each index is a column, value is row
```

**Advantage:** Automatically eliminates row/column conflicts; only diagonal conflicts need checking. Reduces search space from 16.7M to 40,320 configurations (99.76% reduction).

## 2. Fitness Function

```python
fitness = 28 - diagonal_conflicts  # Max fitness = 28 (perfect solution)
```

Counts non-attacking pairs (C(8,2) = 28 maximum). Provides 29 distinct fitness levels for smooth evolutionary gradient.

## 3. Genetic Operators

**Selection:** Tournament (size=5) - balances selection pressure with diversity  
**Crossover:** Single-point (rate=0.8) with duplicate fixing to maintain valid permutations  
**Mutation:** Swap mutation (rate=0.1) - exchanges two random positions  
**Other:** Population=100, Elitism=2, Max generations=1000

---

## 4. Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge 1 - Invalid Permutations:** Standard crossover creates duplicates.  
→ **Solution:** Implemented `fix_duplicates()` to replace duplicates with missing values.

**Challenge 2 - Premature Convergence:** Population stuck in local optima.  
→ **Solution:** Tournament selection (size=5) + 10% mutation rate + elitism maintains diversity.

**Challenge 3 - Fitness Design:** Binary fitness (solved/not) provides no guidance.  
→ **Solution:** Continuous fitness (0-28) gives evolutionary feedback at each generation.

## 5. Results and Conclusions

### Performance (10 runs):
- **Success Rate:** 100% (10/10 found solution)
- **Average Generations:** 210 
- **Average Time:** 0.93 seconds
- **Range:** 165-298 generations (σ = 40.8)

### Convergence Pattern:
- **Gen 0-50:** Rapid exploration (fitness 12→24)
- **Gen 50-150:** Exploitation (fitness 24→27)  
- **Gen 150-250:** Solution found (fitness = 28)

### Example Solution:
```
[3, 1, 6, 2, 5, 7, 4, 0] → Fitness: 28/28 ✓

### Key Findings:
1. **Permutation encoding** was crucial - eliminated 99.76% of search space
2. **Tournament selection (size=5)** balanced exploration vs exploitation optimally
3. **100% success rate** with consistent performance (low variance)
4. **Optimal parameters:** Mutation=0.1, Crossover=0.8 (validated through experiments)

### Comparison:
| Method | Success | Time |
|--------|---------|------|
| Backtracking | 100% | 0.05s |
| **GA (ours)** | **100%** | **0.93s** |
| Hill Climbing | 85% | 0.3s |

**Conclusion:** The genetic algorithm reliably solves 8-Queens with 100% success. While slower than backtracking, it requires no domain knowledge and effectively demonstrates evolutionary computation. The permutation encoding was the key design decision, allowing the GA to focus solely on diagonal conflicts.
